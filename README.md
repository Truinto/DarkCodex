FAQ
-----------
Q: I don't like feature X, can you remove it? \
A: The ingame menu has a list of all patches. You can click them and restart the game to effectively get rid of any feature. You may not be able to load your save, if you already picked feats which are generated by said patch.

Q: Can you make feature X? \
A: At the moment I have enough ideas to fill out my coding hobby. If the scope is small or it is directly related to one of my existing features, then go ahead a open a Github ticket.

Q: What are the options in red? \
A: These cannot be disabled during a playthrough. They become save permanent. I am working to make the menu more clear.
